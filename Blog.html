             <h3>100 Days of ML Challenge</h3>
            <p>A work in progress! My goal for this summer was to try dive head first into growing my technical skills. Whether thats volunteering to pull apart hubs or troubleshoot Thin Clients at work, or trying to put together my own ML-powered chatbot within the next few months! Feel free to reach out if you have any other ideas for gaining hands-on computer engineering skills.</p>

             <h3>Making IT Happen!</h3>
            <p>I'm spending Summer 2018 working in the IT department at TJX Canada. Super excited to be at one of Canada's Best Workplaces for the last 6 years. My favorite moment of the summer so far has been the co-op student socials!</p>

              <h3>My First Hackathon!</h3>
            <p>TOHacks 2018 marked the first hackathon I joined as a participant! If I had to describe the experience in a word, it was overwhelming. All in all, a unique learning experience! Our team was able to pull together BMOre (BMO Real Experience), a web-scrapping tool that perfoms a sentient analysis of tweets about BMO, and displays the information on a user-friendly web interface. Allowing for easy identification and analysis of customer sentiment catered directly to event sponsors, Bank of Montreal.</p>

              <h3>Canadian Undergraduate Tech Conferece</h3>
            <p>I kicked off my summer at CUTC in Waterloo! May 5-6, I had the chance to hear keynotes and panels on the future of Artifical Intelligence, Design, Blockchain, AR/VR, and FinTech. Highlights of the event for me was the keynote by Manish Kothari, President of SRI Internation, and the breakout session on Empathy in Design by Fiona Yeungm designer at Google. I also had the pleasure of meeting like-minded students, studying and working in tech, design, and business.</p>

             <h3>IWD at Google Canada</h3>
            <p>We've all heard it before. The tech industry isn't always the easiest to break into as a woman. I had the incredible opportunity to spend International Womens' Day at Google Canada's Waterloo office, hearing about the phenomenal work being done by female software developers, UX/UI researchers and engineers.The event focused on highlighting the work that these women produces, and their contributions to the tech industry. As they say, you can't be what you can't see!</p>

             <h3>The Management Fam: A Family Biz</h3>
            <p>This year I had the opportunity to get involved with the UW Chapter of the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers. I served as first-year coordinator and had the chance to meet and work with Management Engineering students in every stage of their education at UW. I'm really excited to be taking over our campus chapter as President starting May 2018.</p>

             <h3>Toronto to Montreal in Under 30 Minutes</h3>
            <p>One of my favorite things about UW is there is no shortage of people working on building cool new projects! That's why I joined Waterloop, Canada's hyperloop design team. I'm having an awesome time learning from the team and am looking forward to competing in the SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition soon! </p>

             <h3>Frosh Week!</h3>
            <p>Throwback to week one! If I had one piece of advice for an incoming student; wear comfy shoes! You will definitiely get lost at some point in your first month so be ready to walk circles around campus to figure it out, I defintiely had to! On a more serious note, take a chance to explore campus, and the rest of Waterloo in your time here, the city has a lot to offer!</p>
