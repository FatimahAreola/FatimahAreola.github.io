                <h4>  MSCI 100 GROUP PROJECT: DECISION SUPPORT TOOL  </h4>
                <p> The objective of the MSCI100 term project was to build a "descision support system" that would aid future students in completing projects similar to the MSCI100 term project. This DST was designed to aid a project manager to track individual to-do lists through a GANTT chart. It was designed to be user-friendly and easy to edit, built using VBA and centralized designed to be stored in a Google Drive. Through the process of building our DST, I had the opptunity to learn project management, the Software Development Life Cyle (SLDC) and Visual Basic for Applications. <p>
